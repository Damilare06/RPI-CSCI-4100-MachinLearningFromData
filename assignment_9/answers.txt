Problem 1
	Dimension of Z after 8th order transformation is 300*45

Problem 2
	There is overfitting.

Problem 3
	There is underfitting.

Problem 4
	When Ecv is the minimum, Etest is almost the minimum. So Ecv indicates the best lambda which causes a relatively very small Etest.

Problem 5
	The best lambda is 0.6 with the minimum Ecv 0.1234595712558882

Problem 6
	Estimate Eout is 0.04369582273096729.
